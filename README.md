for the demo logistics implmentation
The provided code implements logistic regression for a weather classification problem using a custom class called CustomLogisticRegression. Here's why this implementation can be considered effective:

Modular Approach: The code follows a modular approach by encapsulating the logistic regression functionality within the CustomLogisticRegression class. This promotes code organization, reusability, and maintainability.

Customization and Flexibility: The implementation allows for customization of learning rate and number of iterations, providing flexibility to experiment and optimize the model's performance.

Softmax Activation: The code incorporates the softmax activation function within the logistic regression model. Softmax converts the output scores into probabilities, enabling multiclass classification and providing more meaningful predictions.

Gradient Descent: The implementation utilizes gradient descent to optimize the weights of the logistic regression model. By iteratively updating the weights based on the calculated errors, the model gradually improves its predictions over time.

Data Organization: The code includes a helper function, organize_data, to properly structure the input data by separating labels and samples. This organization is essential for training and testing the model.

Learning Rate Analysis: The code performs a comprehensive analysis of different learning rates by iterating over a list of predefined values. It measures the accuracy for each learning rate and generates a plot to visualize the relationship between learning rate and accuracy. This analysis helps in selecting an optimal learning rate for the model.

For the naive bayes

Probability Calculation: The implementation calculates probabilities using Gaussian distributions. By estimating the mean and standard deviation of each feature for each class, the classifier can determine the likelihood of a given sample belonging to each class. The use of Gaussian distributions assumes that the features follow a normal distribution, which is a common assumption in many real-world scenarios.
The code evaluates the accuracy of the classifier by comparing the predicted labels with the true labels of the test set. Accuracy provides a measure of how well the classifier performs on unseen data. By measuring accuracy for different smoothing values, the implementation allows for an analysis of the impact of smoothing on classifier performance.
The code includes a data normalization step using the normalize method. This ensures that the input data is appropriately scaled or transformed to adhere to the assumptions of the Naive Bayes algorithm. Normalization helps to improve the accuracy and performance of the classifier.
